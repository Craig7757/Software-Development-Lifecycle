# Software-Development-Lifecycle

User stories are useful when developing for a client because they allow the developer to have insight into how the software is expected to function.
The stories will directly reflect successes found following the implementation of new code developed in response to previous user stories.
When developing in the future I intend to utalize the practice of testing working modles before releasing an update. Agile allows the
development process to be cyclical, this allows for the limitless development and/or improvement of a project. Good teammembers offer insight into 
project-related problems and maintain transparency through out the development cycle.
